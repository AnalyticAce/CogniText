 The goal of the project is to create a program that analyzes real-time temperature data to detect weather aberrations such as droughts, severe colds, hurricanes, or any other extreme climatic conditions. The program must wait for a specified number of days (called period), then output technical indicators such as temperature increase average, relative temperature evolution, standard deviation of temperatures, and alerts when there is a switch in global tendency. Once the "STOP" keyword is entered, the program should output the total number of tendency switches observed and the list of the five biggest aberrations observed during the entire time-series. The program must be written in any language that works on "the dump" and use a Makefile for compilation. The source files and bonus files should be included in the delivery, and error messages should be written to the error output with an exit code of 84 in case of errors.
