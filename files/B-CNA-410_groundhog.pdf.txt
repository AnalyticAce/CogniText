 The goal of the project is to create a program that analyzes real-time temperature data to detect weather aberrations such as droughts, severe colds, hurricanes, or any other extreme climatic conditions. The program must wait for a specified number of days (called period), then output technical indicators such as temperature increase average, relative temperature evolution, standard deviation of temperatures, and alerts when there is a switch in global tendency. The program must also output the total number of tendency switches and the list of the five biggest aberrations observed in the whole time-series when the STOP keyword is entered. The program must be written in any language that works on "the dump" and must be built using a Makefile. The source files must be included in the delivery, and error messages must be written on the error output with the 84 error code.
